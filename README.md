Cogs.js is a JavaScript Library solely for the purpose of data analysis, machine learning, statistics, and algorithms. Built from basic principles of JavaScript and innovative thinking, this library uses ABSOLUTELY ZERO outside libraries (Ti.js is not counted since it was made by me on a separate account, @DarkShadowGithubOfficial, which is no longer my official account). I used my own logical thinking to create this library, and continue to update it regularly to add new features or tweak existing ones. Whenever you need a machine learning library for JavaScript, this is your goto!
